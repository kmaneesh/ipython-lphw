    "**Why is the % character a “modulus” and not a “percent”?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mostly that’s just how the designers chose to use that symbol. In normal writing, you are correct to read it as a “percent.” In programming, this calculation is typically done with simple division and the / operator. The % modulus is a different operation that just happens to use the % symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does % work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to say it is “X divided by Y with J remaining.” For example, “100 divided by 16 with 4 remaining.” The result of % is the J part, or the remaining part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the order of operations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States we use an acronym called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction. That’s the order Python follows as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does / (divide) round down?**\n",
    "It’s not really rounding down; it’s just dropping the fractional part after the decimal. Try doing 7.0 / 4.0 and compare it to 7 / 4 and you’ll see the difference."
