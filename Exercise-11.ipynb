    "**Now** it is time to pick up the pace. I have got you doing a lot of printing so that you get used to typing simple things, but those simple things are fairly boring. What we want to do now is get data into your programs. This is a little tricky because you have to learn to do two things that may not make sense right away, but trust me and do it anyway. It will make sense in a few exercises. Most of what software does is the following:\n",

    "You don’t put your height in there; you type it directly into your Terminal. First thing is, go back and make the code exactly like mine. Next, run the script, and when it pauses, type your height in at your keyboard. That’s all there is to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do you have a new line on line 8 instead of putting it on one line?**\n",
    "That’s so that the line is less than 80 characters long, which is a style that Python programmers like. You could put it on one line if you like.\n",

    "**What’s the difference between input() and raw_input()?**\n",

    "The input() function will try to convert things you enter as if they were Python code, but it has security problems so you should avoid it.\n",
